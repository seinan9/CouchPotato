The bottom of a deep ocean trench, unexplored and mysterious
A toddler sitting on the bottom step, learning to climb stairs
The bottom of a glass bottle, shimmering in the sunlight
The bottom bunk in a bunk bed, a cozy spot for sleepovers
The bottom of a waterfall, where the water crashes into the pool below
The bottom shelf of a bookcase, holding a collection of novels
The bottom rung of a ladder, the first step towards reaching heights
The bottom drawer of a dresser, filled with old photographs and memories
The bottom layer of a wedding cake, waiting to be cut and shared
The bottom line of a financial report, showing profits and losses
The bottom edge of a cliff, overlooking a breathtaking view
The bottom of a well, echoing with mysterious sounds
The bottom button of a coat, fastened to keep out the cold
The bottom of a ski slope, where skiers gather before descending
The bottom of a flowerpot, where roots reach for nourishment
The bottom rack of an oven, baking cookies to perfection
The bottom of a staircase, where shadows linger in the twilight
The bottom lip of a teacup, delicate and chip-free
The bottom tier of a wedding cake, adorned with flowers and frosting
The bottom of a canyon, carved by centuries of flowing water
The bottom line of a contract, outlining terms and conditions
The bottom step of a diving board, launching into the pool below
The bottom floor of a skyscraper, bustling with activity
The bottom of a cereal box, with a surprise toy waiting inside
The bottom of a hiking trail, where adventurers pause to rest
