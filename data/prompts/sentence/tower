the crash demolish the @card@ - foot tower on High Island near Orchard Beach and silence the AM broadcasting operation of WCBS and WNBC . 
we can attribute it to architect Thomas Mackenzie and James Matthews who take on (unknown) in @card@ ; by the time they finish in @card@ they have remove a circular main staircase in favour of a straight one , fit the butler &apos;s stair , complete the west corbel tower and extend the front hall and porch . 
this mean that HSBC get out of the commercial property market at the peak whilst keep their office and , if the leasing company default , HSBC could repossess the tower back again ! 
I explore both path but to the left see a (unknown) (unknown) and two (unknown) (unknown) within about 1 (unknown) of the sign ( keep head straight and level , I do explore the side track but good bird be on the level track to the radio tower even though there be very little (unknown) here ) . 
Richard be a very loyal member of the West Lindsey branch of the (unknown) and of his home tower at (unknown) . 
the central tower be flat on top originally , but look kind of bare , so I make the pyramid top separately and place it on . 
the tower be in the transition style , and the nave be probably of the same date , but it have be remodell in the debase style of the present century . 
however , in March @card@ , a small piece of stone fall from the tower and uncover some huge problem . 
it be not yet clear who own the plane that hit the tower , but United Airlines , own by UAL Corp . 
it be an interesting dream and I can remember image of tree that be wide as clock tower and grow upwards seemingly forever .
