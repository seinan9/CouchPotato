I have a pediatrician friend who , along with the rest of his staff , wear polo_shirt and khaki short in the summer . 
I second Dave &apos;s idea for a polo_shirt . 
I get to Ranger , Texas which be about the 1 / 2 way mark to Abilene and realize that a cold front have blow in and it be cold (unknown) @card@ degree with the wind chill and all i have on be a windbreaker , polo_shirt and a pair of river short and all of my clothes be inside the (unknown) at the front of the truck . 
he put on a dark blue polo_shirt and khaki with black sneakers . 
there be no way i will turn up to an interview for vet school in a polo_shirt and fleece ! 
he wear Jeans and red polo_shirt 6 &apos; 0 @card@ (unknown) . 
he add : &quot; at all three school within the federation uniform consist of a simple polo_shirt , and sweatshirt with the school logo available from local store - the school do not sell uniform . 
there be even a computer-control embroidery sewing machine that can sew your company logo onto a polo_shirt to help you push your brand a little further . 
he sneak around the back and hide parcel in my garden ... a bit like Father Christmas , but in a tight polo_shirt which barely cover his tummy and a pair of short no matter what the weather . 
he look to be at least @card@ year her junior , and his fastidious (unknown) polo_shirt , tight jean , shave head , sculpt facial hair , ever-present (unknown) give a very distinct impression .
