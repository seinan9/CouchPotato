as you know QE 3 be upon us to clear bank balance_sheet of toxic waste and to have $ @card@ billion or more on hand to meet the Fed &apos;s wish . 
this have to be remember , recognise and respect ; the decision that be take in City Hall affect more than number on a balance_sheet , they impact the life of people in our community . 
but look to unpaid worker to fill the gap in your balance_sheet be n&apos;t fair or right . 
they must have make their balance_sheet look incredibly rosy as they sell million of pair ... despite the rain . 
there be also scope for those prepare to finance a project on balance_sheet with a view to sell their investment follow completion . 
I would suggest you look at the effect of have company car finance on your balance_sheet . 
that be part of the system capital adequacy and lending problem ; the only supplier of credit where it be be supply now be the the Fed and the bank balance_sheet that pre-date shadow banking . 
that be the wrong signal ; other with big balance_sheet continue to fund themselves . 
she return to the bank as Executive (unknown) , Corporate Treasury , in @card@ , with responsibility for Royal Bank &apos;s balance_sheet management , funding , liquidity and portfolio management . 
there be some positive (unknown) item , such as the continued balance_sheet size reduction at some of the UK bank .
