I would always snail_mail any correspondence by recorded delivery if it be important as this provide an evidential chain for receipt - (unknown) can get eat you be only permit by law to be represent by a union rep or a work colleague , but you would be entitle to take either of these . 
there be occasion when snail_mail arrive at the wrong address , or we need to see a document which the other have , but with scanner available and the use of (unknown) , that be not really a problem . 
I have many opportunity when I be at University ( I be get 1 offer very other day in the old &quot; snail_mail &quot; ) . 
he emigrate to New Zealand in early @card@ and marry Diane three week later - they meet when he be in Australia three year earlier and they have keep in touch by snail_mail - it be (unknown) communication ! 
I tend to publish a book a year , so I usually get a rough together in three , four , five month ; tinker when I get time and send thing (unknown) to electronic magazine ( because it be easy than the old (unknown) snail_mail thing , and time be of the essence , both in term of composition and keep return out there in poet puffery land in the winter . 
I be wonder if there be any point try snail_mail now , or will they just ignore that as well ? 
I be always available , both by snail_mail ( liberated Christian , (unknown) Box @card@ , Phoenix , AZ @card@ @card@ ) and by (unknown) at : (unknown) . 
we be all connect via (unknown) , cell phone , reunion , (unknown) , snail_mail , etc. I know that no matter where life take me I will always have the support of the amazing people follow me . 
I eventually decide to cancel - to find that there be now a Â£ @card@ cessation charge that it appear be notify by (unknown) to a (unknown) (unknown) address ( not snail_mail ) supply when I take out my (unknown) account . 
I have contribute again just as often in response to (unknown) thank me as I have to snail_mail .
