in @card@ , at the age of @card@ , Folke come to the United States for what be originally intend as a one-year stay with an aunt reside in California . 
in the hope that he might help me I say , &quot; our mother leave us year ago , and we be try to find her through our aunt &apos;s address . 
as an aside ... the bad dog I have ever meet be my auntie &apos;s Yorkshire (unknown) , who be call Tatters ... nasty through and through , jealous of anyone who speak to my aunt . 
if an aunt could not marry her nephew neither could an uncle marry his niece . 
our baby girl be bear without life in her body , but with great life in her parent , grandparent , uncle , aunt , and cousin . 
I have a recipe book hand down to me which belong to my great great aunt who be in service in the kitchen at (unknown) in the late 19th century . 
he be the only one who I can think of , though do n&apos;t mean there be not more - just mean I (unknown) &apos; t think of them and Chabon &apos;s not get (unknown) same (unknown) as you , so he fly over lot of element a bit superficially my (unknown) and one of my (unknown) aunt flee to Kiev after the Kishinev pogrom , but that be a lot later ... 
I stay in @card@ with my mom , aunt , and cousin . 
it must be those summer week , along with various wedding and (unknown) eve party and thanksgiving , with great aunt and uncle and second cousin in tow , that give me a severe case of nostalgia in the middle of night recently . 
the story of your aunt smashing thing be sadly familiar from my experience with my Dad who do throw thing at staff , mostly the photograph ( with glass and frame ) , that be suppose to remind him of his family .
