&quot; it might deter people from use the road as a rat_run . 
there be an absolute solution to rat_run - make the road in question a no through road by (unknown) one end off - this have be do to a road near me , and , whilst a few resident do n&apos;t like it , most support the idea @card@ % and could live with the (unknown) . 
that be , a northern bypass must be in place to take traffic away from Westerfield and Henley Road and the associate &apos; rat_run &apos; to Norwich Road and the A @card@ and a @card@ . 
he quote Mr (unknown) as say &apos; I know of some very bad case ... place where rat_run in and out - sewer rat , too . 
he say : &quot; this will turn Northway into a polluted rat_run . 
it be n&apos;t the heat , the smell , the lack of run water or a refrigerator , the malaria phobia or the overgrow rat_run around on the same floor where Teri and Zach be sleep , or the lack of a bathroom or morning coffee , it be all these thing combined (unknown) 
we suggest that the current road width should be retain , and it would be advisable to consider speed hump or table for the length of East Heath Road ( and Pond Street , Fleet Road &amp; Constantine Road although the ambulance service would probably object to this ) to reduce rat_run traffic and traffic speed . 
I live on a suburban street which be use as a rat_run for driver try to avoid a slow set of light . 
he explain that issue be consider close once they have be solve or when they be take on by a partner organisation or a work group , for example the issue of rat_run have be take on by the traffic work group . 
we suggest that a cheap and far more effective alternative would be to install permanent road closure on some or all of the road subject to rat_run .
