however , the winter before us be see an especially large &apos; irruption &apos; of snowy owl : an episodic boom in which the bird be distribute more widely and in much great number . 
it would n&apos;t just be deliver by a single owl ( &quot; via Hermes &quot; ) 2 ) I have read in one of the 5 book ( but can locate it right now ) that if the game run too long , relief player come on . 
we drive overnight from Tampere to Oulu , where we be meet by (unknown) guide (unknown) Topp ( crazy name , crazy guy ) , at about 5 be , he promptly whisk us off to a Great Grey (unknown) site ( one of my target bird for the trip ) , with the (unknown) caveat that the young owl have flow the nest the day before , so they may be hard to find . 
these be little tiny owl only about 6 @card@ inch tall that live in burrow in the ground . 
it be no owl . 
he have record other bird moment before and , when play back , hear the owl call quietly in the background , look around for a suitable place and calmly produce the bird . 
it be a calm , sweet April night ; there be no sound but a few low note of a nightingale , and nothing move but the white cloud near the moon and a brown owl that flit over the hedge . 
I see this owl twice last September , type south shield eagle owl in (unknown) . 
we pick this ring together after Ross propose with a large golden owl ring from (unknown) , complete with ruby eye and glass ! 
we hear (unknown) owl call before dawn .
