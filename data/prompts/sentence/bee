as I expect you be aware the number of bee colony in England have decrease during the last few year and I be work to help slow this decline which be threaten the productivity of local farm and market garden . 
there be certain precaution you should take when work alongside bee . 
there be still bee leave in the brood box too , be it possible to have two queen in a caste ? 
when you be lift frame and mess around with move hive piece around , the last thing you want to deal with when your hand be full be a bee sting your face , or crawl up your nose , ear or mouth ; you will drop what you be do in a hurry when that happen , and thing only get bad from there . 
they be small than most honey bee I have see . 
if association be have a real surge in membership which be what I hear from all over , from Brighton to Aberdeen , how be it possible for the beekeeper number to rise dramatically and ( I dangerously assume they have or get bee ) consequent colony number fall ? 
I do n&apos;t think that let my bee swarm and not check them or forget be my hive are be a responsible way of look after my bee that be your point of view and that be how it should be , however it work here in France and I suspect it be work in the UK , certainly with feral colony at any rate . 
the bee may well have learn that they lose pollen when they go through a pollen trap , but if its the only way into their home they will do it anyway . 
I be assume that the (unknown) side of thing have bee sort , (unknown) that any floor box , cable have be put in place and that existing cable be long enough for any new configuration . 
(unknown) (unknown) fly parasite lay egg inside honey bee and cause neurological change , create &quot; walker bee .
