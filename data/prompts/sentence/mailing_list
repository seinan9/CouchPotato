I wish to update my address / be remove from your mailing_list / remove a deceased individual from the mailing_list . 
if a (unknown) would like to remove themselves from your mailing_list , they will only have to click on the (unknown) link , locate in your newsletter .

I look at (unknown) too - its interesting - but it be not really a mailing_list and more of a forum .

they try it , the love it , and they mail out to their own mailing_list , recommend the product ( provide a testimonial ) not to me , but to their own customer base about the result they have have with the service .
