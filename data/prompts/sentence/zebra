be my tank over stock : I have (unknown) @card@ fish tank with standard biological filter 5 cherry shrimp 3 silver molly + one baby 8 neon tetra 2 zebra danio 2 dwarf (unknown) 5 clown loach I have lot be of plant and 2 day ago I find 4 snail in my tank . 
I be a ( ( insert job etc. at ( time ) on ( date ) I be cycle along ( insert name of road ) from A to B when I reach the zebra cross at ( insert location . ) I see a motor car ( insert know detail ) ahead of me on that road stop on the approach to the crossing , within the area contain by the zig-zag marking . 
there be a few way to make this happen in a new tank , from add ammonia from a bottle ( (unknown) Can Be no live fish , Live Plants Or Any (unknown) Thing in (unknown) Tank if you (unknown) This (unknown) ) , to add a couple of hardy fish ( zebra danio , guppy , (unknown) catfish ) and test like mad and change water when need -- such as if the ammonia and / or nitrite get over @card@ @card@ ppm . 
if you have child in pram you take you life into your own hand as traffic and parking be a nightmare and not one person stop on a zebra cross for you unless the be a visit from another country they even park on the crossing ? 
I think (unknown) out of the question and i hear (unknown) do n&apos;t travel or acclimatize well which leave (unknown) for the (unknown) and zebra and (unknown) for the dwarf . 
there be a game corridor pass through the area surround the lake , so zebra , giraffe and many antelope be often see , plus in the private reserve and conservancy you can see rhino , Grevy &apos;s zebra , eland , ostrich , hyaena and many other . 
there be only restriction with regard to placement near zebra , pelican and puffin crossing , rail track , tram track and bridge . 
they be all catch on either the # @card@ red body midge , or # @card@ bead head zebra midge . 
if you check the photo , you can clearly see the black jaguar position slightly ahead of the zebra cross , outside the BMA , and conveniently just behind the bus . 
there be clear and obvious difference between human and zebra fish .
