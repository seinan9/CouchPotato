another shocking aspect of A. D. M. Jabalpur be that it establish beyond doubt our judge do really live in ivory_tower totally oblivious of the ground reality . 
it seem a natural for translation , give the modishness of the topic in the ivory_tower - it remain to be see how good the overall quality be . 
I find this ironic because the &apos; ivory_tower &apos; be exactly what you be argue for - you want knowledge that be not political , that be not ideological , that be not engage with the reality on &apos; the ground &apos; . 
there be other more important concern for the faithful that the Vatican should be be address and in do so perhaps will win the heart and co-operation of the faithful who sadly for the most part consider the Vatican live in an ivory_tower and be far from be in tune with the grass_root . 
it also give the writer a social and cultural consciousness too often lack in ivory_tower writing .

I think it be important not to set yourself up in an ivory_tower . 
there be no &quot; ivory_tower &quot; , or talk of &quot; career guru &quot; , in our Management Team . 
there be not an ivory_tower in sight , no professor in musty (unknown) study churn out incomprehensible paper , no inflexible plan that Must be adhere to . 
be that they sit in their ivory_tower , sling (unknown) * t at successful competitor product , without ask themselves honestly what it be that be cause people to buy them .
