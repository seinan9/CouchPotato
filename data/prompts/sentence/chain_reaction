he hold in his hand the knowledge need to create a perfect implosion that could trigger a nuclear chain_reaction inside a small spherical core . 
if fission become a chain_reaction , the energy of the nucleus of the uranium atom might be release . 
she illustrate the point by propose a fictitious , but highly credible , scenario : &apos; suppose , for example , that a chain_reaction have commence in an outdated nuclear reactor in Ukraine that be threaten to grow beyond control , with the imminent threat of a Chernobyl-style nuclear explosion . 
I think it be more of a culmination of frustration that have be build for month and now a chain_reaction of exasperation . 
it will probably surprise the person and may even start a chain_reaction ! 
it take shape in @card@ , when Enrico Fermi achieve nuclear fission , and on December 2 , @card@ , when the first successful nuclear chain_reaction take place under a sport stadium at the University of Chicago . 
be n&apos;t all that Co 2 suppose to be a planet killer that once release set off a permanent chain_reaction and make the entire earth a second Venus ? 
it start a chain_reaction of quake . 
there be a story in the Munich-based (unknown) Zeitung last month say that North Korea have be assist Iran with some dual-use nuclear data that be highly control because it can help scientist learn how to control a chain_reaction . 
he collaborate with Fermi and Anderson in some experiment preliminary to the production of a chain_reaction .
