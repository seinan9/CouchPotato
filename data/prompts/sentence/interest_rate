the question of what will your interest_rate be be now will you even get a loan prove me wrong if you be read this and you (unknown) be approve for a loan or response to what rate can i get with my credit score . 
both be interest_rate on which lender may base your loan . 
instead , relatively stable growth , abundance of speculative capital worldwide , combine with the high interest_rate in the world lead to an inflow of capital that strengthen the real ( the Brazilian currency ) . 
I wo n&apos;t be shift from Â£ be to Euro be any time soon , not unless I see a drop in interest_rate from the Boe ( i will have my finger on the button midday on rate set day (unknown) ) , coz I still think we will see 6 % interest_rate by January and @card@ % before Easter . 
however , the timing and scale of interest_rate rise be be delicately judge as private demand and confidence be especially fragile . 
we now have the full benefit of know how output and inflation evolve , but the (unknown) have to rely on projection when it come to set interest_rate . 
we keep interest_rate down and it be easy for you to borrow money in the private sector , so you create more job . 
while we will always applaud low interest_rate , investor seem to feel that the low rate environment mean the market should immediately rally . 
the number of home sell surge up by @card@ (unknown) last month , help by frozen interest_rate and the &quot; loose mortgage lending condition see since the Lehman Brothers collapse &quot; but Britain &apos;s big building society warn that house price remain @card@ (unknown) more expensive than the historic norm . 
the harm to people from collapse far exceed the harm in lose interest from fix the low interest_rate in order to forestall collapse .
