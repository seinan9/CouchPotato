it help if you be a good listener and a bit of an agony_aunt ! 
I teach some (unknown) kid , and some of them really do n&apos;t get any parental support whatsoever , in fact one aunt come to the school and use it as an agony_aunt session because she ca n&apos;t look after her own kid or the niece and nephew she have to look after too . 
I feel this go beyond a standard &apos; agony_aunt &apos; column due to the connotation the &apos; psychologist &apos; title have for the public , even though she be not explicitly claim to be a (unknown) psychologist . 
we run the feature a few year ago , but somehow manage to let it tail off , so I have decide to step up and offer my service as resident (unknown) agony_aunt , provide highly subjective yet heartfelt advice , free of gender stereotype , beauty fascism and (unknown) exhortation to buy stuff you do n&apos;t need . 
To put a few (unknown) pound in to long term contraception for these woman be sensible and it really frustrate me to hear opinion like the one voice by the &quot; agony_aunt &quot; today . 
&quot; do n&apos;t consider it until you be at least @card@ , &quot; say an agony_aunt . 
thank you Helen Gould PS if you want an agony_aunt for distressed hairdresser Im your woman . 
promise a truly alternative woman &apos;s magazine , with a focus on life not lifestyle , the (unknown) Times web_site will launch with the first column from our radical agony_aunt , piece cover feminist (unknown) and the marketing of austerity , plus much more . 
she be (unknown) &apos;s (unknown) life coach and broadcast regularly on radio and television and have be the resident psycho therapist for Channel 4 &apos;s (unknown) and agony_aunt for yes ! 
he do n&apos;t solve our problem like a great all-powerful agony_aunt or fairy godmother .
