here future captain and admiral sail their miniature fleet , and be as helplessly horror-stricken when the graceful swan sally out and attack their little vessel , as when from (unknown) Monroe the spectator watch the &quot; Merrimac &quot; steam down upon the shipping in the road . 
these day the most threatening feature , apart from novice eight and some man &apos;s first eight , be namely swan and the Georgina ( amongst other cruiser ) . 
he also once find a wing from a dead swan , and boy be it trouble to get him to drop it ! 
it be relate to the goose and swan but be small . 
there be so many bird watch place around Inverness that there be a wide choice but if the interest be in wader , wildfowl , not forget mute , whooper and Bewick &apos;s swan , then the firth be ideal . 
I have a @card@ estate with an original (unknown) towbar fit , which be of the swan neck type . 
it mean the swan be able to help a local club in the USA while raise their profile and the profile of Swansea Bay as a visitor destination at the same time . 
do n&apos;t you leave your own country till your trial come on , for they never will hang you for shoot a swan . 
as it start to rain , the swan look very much at home . 
she be sit demurely on some rock like she be in Central Park watch the swan .
