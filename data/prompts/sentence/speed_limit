of the @card@ monitor at Kenton , almost @card@ exceed the speed_limit . 
there be no speed_limit for most of the way and people do like to push their vehicle to the limit of their performance envelope . 
be it a @card@ mph because thee be a system of street lighting and sign be not allow except for sign be the speed_limit change ? 
I think that a &apos; speed_limit &apos; of @card@ @card@ be not a bad idea for a motorway , if it be enforce by police officer who be well place to judge whether creep up to @card@ on a desert stretch at 2 am be really dangerous driving . 
I wait patiently for the green (unknown) arrow at (unknown) and I also wait for the green at the bottom of the hill at Maine Ave , since most of the cross traffic be @card@ + mph over the speed_limit . 
it be a good point though that maybe the City Council should have a map showing where the different speed_limit be , however , some might say , the sign be plain to see on the street , if you do n&apos;t know what the speed_limit be on any give stretch of road , then you should assume it be low or risk get point and a fine ... 
I have an article pend on what the speed_limit should be for (unknown) with some interesting math . 
there be a lot to be say for variable speed_limit though . 
there be a long list of comment about the negative effect and the abuse of speed camera from respected police , academic and other source in the speed_limit section of the web_site of the Association of British Drivers ( (unknown) ) . 
I say this because when I drive in school zone or on road that be @card@ mph I notice that it take a bit of concentration to ( and I tend to tick people off for actually drive at or below the speed_limit ) .
