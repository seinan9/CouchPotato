I take this picture in a parking_lot near Cote (unknown) Metro . 
when we finally get roll at around 3 be , we pull out of the parking_lot , drive for about @card@ meter , there be a loud crunch noise down below , the bus roll to stop and the interior of the bus go completely dark . 
there be the Kroger (unknown) on Cemetery with a big parking_lot or the next one where the Battery plus store be , or the lot at (unknown) or Lowe &apos;s area or the old Big Bear area or even good the Movie (unknown) , you might catch some movie goer on the leave or before the movie (unknown) food truck to Hilliard please ! 
they keep laboratory road , parking_lot , walkway and electrical equipment clear of snow and ice to allow the laboratory to continue operation in a safe and reliable manner . 
we find these bird by walk downstream from the parking_lot for about @card@ m till where you cross a fence with a few strand remain . 
as they leave the parking_lot , they look East and see the moon start to come up . 
they spend the day attend mathematics talk , mostly give by undergraduate , and then gather in the parking_lot for a group photo . 
I be tell to meet them in the school parking_lot after dark . 
he could tell by the car be not in the parking_lot , likely no one be home in the building . 
&quot; we have to clean all the flour and chalk mark from the parking_lot before they let us go , &quot; say the woman who be the hare for that event .
