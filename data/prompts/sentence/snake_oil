it be the equivalent of a snake_oil debate for the 21st century . 
it be not only snake_oil that get a bad name but turn out to have some level of effectiveness . 
be this not , however , a bonus room by another name , where developer simply charge more for all the snake_oil (unknown) ? 
I know Dave of Planet @card@ (unknown) well ; he be get as much patience for snake_oil as I have for Big (unknown) . 
I think this demonstrate that despite what the Seattle snake_oil salesman have to say , (unknown) never be and never will be a serious os and certainly not one fit for @card@ / 7 use in a high availability corporate enviroment . 
I think I will stick to good old fashion cast iron for me , I think (unknown) pan be just plan obsolescence snake_oil (unknown) . 
I understand that run more often in the high torque range will improve fuel consumption but @card@ % good with no real explanation sound like &quot; snake_oil &quot; to me . 
there be plenty of &quot; (unknown) &quot; and snake_oil salesman in this business know as Seo ( search_engine optimization ) but (unknown) be the real thing . 
be Jon Maguire involve or some other fund marketeer type snake_oil salesman (unknown) 
that be why (unknown) degenerate in the end , (unknown) everyone have their own opinion , I do n&apos;t think one can really argue with science , or engineering , it do n&apos;t lie , but (unknown) I have (unknown) say be people be own , and each think he be right , include me (unknown) , and that end up in forum fight I do tend to gravitate more towards objective truth , (unknown) lack of snake_oil , perhaps wrong word that , hence be at odd with the forum ethos , which do make me wonder , and you be right to hint , that sometimes , this my presence on the forum be not conductive , i merely try to encourage and challenge people a bit , and if peep interpret that wrong , then I be sorry about that .
