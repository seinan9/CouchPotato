of course there be no guarantee that Halo &apos;s (unknown) be a (unknown) , but the timing of the (unknown) and of the last firing of Halo do appear to happen at approximately the same time . 
I creep into a firing position , take a grenade from my belt and intend lob it although to throw it the require @card@ yard from a prone position be ask a lot . 
there be also an allowance of Â£ 2 , @card@ shilling to each for firing . 
I be look at these page and notice the suggestion that the blue beam from the tower could be simulation of Halo firing . 
when (unknown) (unknown) , the monitor of installation @card@ , be speak with the Prophet of (unknown) , he mention that the ring be able to fire at any give moment , have succesfully complete @card@ trillion simulation and one actual firing . 
when Conlon give the order to move in , they begin firing . 
he should be court (unknown) for his crime and then throw in a hole so deep (unknown) will ever find him again or simply execute him by a firing squad - (unknown) standard procedure during wartime . 
they run across the ground at a rapid pace catch up with the flee (unknown) ship in the sky firing as they traverse across the earth . 
he shout to his man , tell them to cease firing - that the man in the front rank be fire into their own man . 
he be kill by a firing squad when the liberal lose the war .
