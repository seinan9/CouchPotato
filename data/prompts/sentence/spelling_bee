I feel like spelling_bee find me , as do the @card@ influenza epidemic . 
I do n&apos;t get to do the school one in sixth because I be in the hospital when the (unknown) be go on , and in eighth grade my English teacher could n&apos;t run a spelling_bee correctly . 
do spelling_bee mean the same thing today ? 
simply create a word list and save it as a spelling_bee . 
I realize that part of my own fascination with the spelling_bee -- and part of the reason I think it make the national news and be televise on ESPN every year -- lie in the fact that it be so easy to recognize ourselves in these kid and in this ridiculous contest . 
spell German - in English it should come as no great surprise that an English-language spelling_bee would include German and other &quot; foreign &quot; word . 
administer the school spelling_bee allow him the great pleasure of observe his good and bright . 
use the score system from Horse Basketball to determine the winner of a spelling_bee .
