I be browse around the web and I have never hear of cleft lip defect before . 
it show up over seventy time in the gospel , almost always on the lip of Jesus himself . 
&quot; I love her , &quot; he say through dry lip . 
it be afford to us through your contribution ; we as a company receive it as such , and we have already pledge ourselves to stand by that flag as long as there be a rebel either North or South who shall open his lip in opposition to the cause of freedom . 
he lean to kiss her lip once more , before take her hand and lead her away to the more private ground . 
I bite my lip ; the rope be secure . 
when you have pluck the drown man from the water , and lay him on the bank , and the colour flush again on his cheek , and the pulse beat again at his wrist , and speech again return to these blue and livid lip , then may you speculate on how he fall into the flood . 
Daniel find himself fall back , pull Jack with him , over him , the need to feel more than his lip against him become just as overwhelming . 
and when they be mention at all , the grovel apology be already be form on the lip . 
I press my finger to my lip to urge the other not to make a sound .
