but an amendment to the Bill , table by the Education Secretary Ed Balls , suggest these principle could be dilute by head_teacher and govern body of faith school , so that teaching reflect a &quot; school &apos;s religious character &quot; . 
you will provide advice by phone and (unknown) to head_teacher and governor and will visit school to facilitate meeting an support hearing . 
&quot; I be particularly concern about the way in which Mrs Cain &apos;s private (unknown) to her church friend end up in the hand of the head_teacher . 
I think it be dependent on the head_teacher to a degree . 
if you have a disabled badge or have any other reason why you think you would be entitle to use the school car_park , please contact the school office who will request a parking permit from the head_teacher . 
that mean a package of letter can be send in each direction every term , which head_teacher Jane Husbands say be ideal , as it sustain the child &apos;s interest without be too much for them . 
I think it be regrettable that the school feel it have to choose this path and agree with Sarah that most of the change the head_teacher claim be necessary could easily take place without have to opt for academy status . 
be head_teacher Brooks a thoughtless bully ? 
she agree and say we should ask one of the &apos; team leader &apos; teacher , who say we have to ask the head_teacher ... who say she have to ask the owner . 
do n&apos;t you have any law against misconduct in public office that could be bring again that head_teacher and police officer for the egregious breach of right .
