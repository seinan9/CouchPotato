I put mine on my kitchen calendar so I have always get a record . 
next time I will add one more squash as mine be a bit small . 
the mine of native metal , as gold , silver , copper , and so on , be valuable then , as now , require no processing save smelt . 
I leave mine open full width . 
that be , they have perhaps @card@ @card@ year of mine life remain . 
it now cost several billion dollar to build big mine . 
it be a pet peeve of mine , people opine with the preface &quot; I do n&apos;t know (unknown) &apos; about (unknown) &apos; no baby , &quot; but go on nonetheless . 
I clarify that their motive and ultimate vision may be quite different from mine . 
it be not mine to question , but it smack of bait-and-switch to me ! 
the steam engine give much good drainage and help the mine to develop more efficiently .
